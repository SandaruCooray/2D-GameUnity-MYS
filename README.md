3. NPC Behavior: Zombies are the primary NPCs with behaviors such as chasing, attacking, and taking damage.
4. Physics-Based Movement: Realistic player movement, including walking, jumping, and shooting.
5. Environmental Hazards: Moving obstacles like saws and maces that add challenge to the gameplay.
